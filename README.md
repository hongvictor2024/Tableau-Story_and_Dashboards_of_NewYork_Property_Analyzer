Introduction
The goal of this project is to employ Tableau on publicly available data relevant to assessing the attractiveness of properties in New York. The objective is help an investor prospect for a property to stay and rent. The hypothetical client in question possesses the following characteristics and preferences - the criteria was chosen to
reflect the likely preferences of contemporary home-owners and investors:

● Budget: $2 million USD
● Location: Manhattan, New York
● Type of Property: Residential
● Accessibility: Close proximity to subway stations
● Leisure: Close proximity to tourist attractions
● Rental Preferences: Prefer to rent during winter months (client goes
somewhere warm during winter season)
● Other Concerns: Prefer area to be safe from violent crimes or home break-ins

The goal of the study is to use visualisation and other preparatory tools to provide an investor as much useful information as possible in a concise manner to not overload the investor but also facilitate the investor to make an informed decision at the end of the day. These include factors that likely play a role for future home-owners or travellers, such as space, safety, accessibility, attractions and price. 

Given the richness of dimensions and size of the datasets, conventional tools such as Excel would be hard-pressed to process, much less, present the data. Hence Python was used to clean and process the data, as well as engineer new features where necessary.
Tableau was used as a visualisation tool owing to its efficiency in handling large amounts of data, as well as its diversity of tools to present data in an elegant, intuitive and dynamic manner for users.
